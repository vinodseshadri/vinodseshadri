# Books I liked

## Tommorrow tommorrow and tommorrow by  Gabrielle Zevin

A nostalgic book that reminded me of my childhood. This is a story of two friends trying to make it big in the world of early video game industry. It is hard to put it down and well written

## Victory City  by Salman Rushdie

A quasi blend of fiction and non fiction , Victory City is a a story of Vijayanagar and Hampi set in a fantasy world . Though its comes very close being the perfect historical fiction. It falls a bit short of perfection.
